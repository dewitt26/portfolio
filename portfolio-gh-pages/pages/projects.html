    <div class=box>To the right you can see my gimp final project. For this project I used various photo editing tools on Gimp to photoshop minnesota symbols into the shape of Minnesota outlines.The symbols I selected include the lady slipper, the Minneapolis skyline, and a loon. The background in which the minnesotas are layered on top of is a scene from a snowy Minnesota winter.</div>

               <div class=box>	Some of the main challenges of lightning for me was being able to add and size the picture correctly so that the picture was placed on top of the lightning. I was able to fix it by going into gimp and resizing and removing the pictures background. I also edited the picture size and coordinates on processing to position it correctly. My other main issue was making it so the lightning appeared at the rate I wanted it to, but I was also able to fix that by adding a frame count. The last main challenge I faced was converting my code to JavaScript. I was able to do that by getting help from others and looking up things in the p5 reference online.
