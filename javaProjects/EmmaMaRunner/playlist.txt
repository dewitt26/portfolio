So when my thoughts take off may I breathe deep
Lord, hold me strong when old loss comes to meet me
Keep my fingers crossed, keep my knees weak
Are we all such fragile things?
And may we remember the past but not hang on to our old ways
Let's pity laugh at the jokes we tell in bad taste
All my friends think I'm funny in a sad way
But they know not how they speak
Oh my God
While we sit and wait for time
To change our luck
And open up our blinds
Oh don't you know
Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind
Oh I, catastrophize
Oh I, catastrophize
Let me see the world through the kindness of my dad's eyes
Let every photograph be taken from my bad side
So when the world sees my face they'll never ask why
I look the way I do
So let my soul be the only thing to guide me
I'll tour the world and hope my anger dies behind me
So if I fail I can blame it on bad timing
I'll love nothing that I can lose
Oh my God
While we sit and wait for time
To change our luck
And open up our blinds
Oh don't you know
Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind
Oh I, catastrophize
Oh I, catastrophize
Oh my God
While we sit and wait for time
To change our luck
And open up our blinds
Oh don't you know
Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind
Oh I, catastrophize
Oh I, catastrophize
Oh my God
While we sit and wait for time
To change our luck
And open up our blinds
Oh don't you know
Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind
Oh I, catastrophize
Oh I, catastrophize


I wonder why I get paranoid when I'm high
I wonder why I say yes to everyone in my life
I wonder why I can't run that fast in my dreams
I wonder why I feel short when I know my money's tall
I wonder why I miss everyone and I still don't call
I wonder why I can't run that fast in my dreams
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn't need faith
I guess if I never fell, I guess I wouldn't need grace
I guess if I knew His plans, I guess He wouldn't be God
So maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
Maybe that's okay, maybe that's okay
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
I wonder why I feel emptiness and I sing these blues
I wonder why I feel hopelessness when I watch the news
I wonder why I can't find my voice in my dreams
I wonder why they say hate your brother and hide your gold
I wonder why we all fear the things that we might not know
I wonder why I can't find my voice in my dreams
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn't need faith
I guess if I never fell, I guess I wouldn't need grace
I guess if I knew His plans, I guess He wouldn't be God
So maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
Maybe that's okay, maybe that's okay
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
All this shit, I can't explain
Is it by design or random fate, yeah
So maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
Maybe that's okay, maybe that's okay
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay


I hear the rumors outside
Decide to not call your bluff
It's time to delegate wise
Is what we have planned enough?
I'm saying, saying
It's no problem, come over later
My folks are not persistent
But who's got the dead presidents?
'Cause mine remain non-existent
All my friends are conversating
Waiting at the front door, patiently
I still gotta ask one favor
Can I get a twenty for a real good time?
Two tens, I'm not tryna go crazy
Give you my honesty that I won't do lines
But I can't speak for Stacy
I'll call you, I'll call you, oh, the second that I get there
I don't want you calling other parents because you're scared
Listen, I just need a twenty for a real good time
Two tens, I'm not tryna go crazy
Stop staring right through the window
You're gonna cause a stir
My parents might get upset
And not let us leave the 'burbs
So give me two seconds, let me sweet talk 'em
This shouldn't last more than a minute
But if they ask, "Son, where is it you're going?"
My night may as well be finished
All my friends are conversating
Waiting at the front door, patiently
I still gotta ask one favor
Can I get a twenty for a real good time?
Two tens, I'm not tryna go crazy
Give you my honesty that I won't do lines
But I can't speak for Stacy
I'll call you, I'll call you, oh, the second that I get there
I don't want you calling other parents because you're scared
Listen, I just need a twenty for a real good time
Two tens, I'm not tryna go crazy
Don't you run from me
(I'll be back around 10:30)
It's 9:30, see
(Okay, I gotta go, don't worry)
You're too young to see
(All my friends are in a hurry)
Nothing's ever free
Can I get a twenty for a real good time?
Two tens, I'm not tryna go crazy
Give you my honesty that I won't do lines
But I can't speak for Stacy
I'll call you, I'll call you, oh, the second that I get there
I don't want you calling other parents because you're scared
Listen, I just need a twenty for a real good time
Two tens, I'm not tryna go crazy


My new address is hard to remember
So I wrote it on the back of my hand
'Cause I leave the nest, this coming December
To make it as a grown man
I'm about to lose my only defenders
I'm packing up whatever I can
Been waiting for today but
All I can think to say is
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Can we keep my Legos at home?
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
People want shirts with the band name on it
And suddenly we ain't so bad
Saved up enough to rent an apartment
Far away from mom and dad
My Christmas card looks like a mugshot
'Cause suddenly I'm getting sad
Been waiting for today but
All I can think to say is
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Can we keep my Legos at home
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
Can we keep my Legos at home
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
It's cold out there, you're standing there
You're trying to face your greatest fear
You're shivering, you're trembling
It's warm in here so come back in
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh, no, I'll come home when I'm grown
It won't be the same though
I can't even go home, go home
Can we keep my Legos at home?
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
