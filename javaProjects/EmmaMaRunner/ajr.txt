My new address is hard to remember
So I wrote it on the back of my hand
'Cause I leave the nest, this coming December
To make it as a grown man
I'm about to lose my only defenders
I'm packing up whatever I can
Been waiting for today but
All I can think to say is
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Can we keep my Legos at home?
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
People want shirts with the band name on it
And suddenly we ain't so bad
Saved up enough to rent an apartment
Far away from mom and dad
My Christmas card looks like a mugshot
'Cause suddenly I'm getting sad
Been waiting for today but
All I can think to say is
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Can we keep my Legos at home
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
Can we keep my Legos at home
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on
It's cold out there, you're standing there
You're trying to face your greatest fear
You're shivering, you're trembling
It's warm in here so come back in
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh no, don't throw out my Legos
What if I can't let go
What if I come back home, back home
Oh, no, I'll come home when I'm grown
It won't be the same though
I can't even go home, go home
Can we keep my Legos at home?
'Cause I wanna move out
I don't wanna move on

Frankly, I'm scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk it's like:
"Wow, I'm not crazy"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't kill me, 'cause I'm just the messenger
I already went and took my temperature
And I'm not sick, I took all my vitamins
Yeah, I'm not sick, I'm just kind of different
Oh, different, so different
They tell us to be different
But no one told me I could go too far
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Frankly, I'm scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk it's like:
"Wow, I'm not crazy" (Ooh)
Frankly, I feel insane
But you say you feel the same
And suddenly it's like:
"Hey, I'm not crazy!"
'Cause when you talk it's like:
"Wow, I'm not crazy"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't kill me, 'cause I'm just the messenger
I've never seen someone quite this strange before
You're just like me, you took all your vitamins
You're just like me, and you take delight in it
Oh, different, so different
They tell us to be different
But no one told me I could go too far
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Frankly, I'm scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk it's like:
"Wow, I'm not crazy" (Ooh)
Frankly, I feel insane
But you say you feel the same
And suddenly it's like:
"Hey, I'm not crazy!"
'Cause when you talk it's like:
"Wow, I'm not crazy"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you talk it's like, "Wow!"
When you talk it's like, "Wow!"
When you talk it's like, "Wow!"
When you talk it's like, "Wow!"
When you talk it's like, "Wow!"
When you talk it's like, "Wow!"
Frankly, I'm scared of clowns
And get-togethers get me down
But when you talk it's like, "Wow!"
"I'm not crazy"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Remember when we all got drunk?
I ended up with two broke thumbs
Oh my God, I felt so dumb, lucky me
I wrote a song that no one knows
I played a show and no one showed
Oh my God, I felt so alone, lucky me
When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
What you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?
Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
Yeah, no, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
Remember when she broke my heart
Waitin' for the waiter to return my card?
Right as I let down my guard, lucky me
We had to work a bit more hard
Only just to get a little bit less far
We could laugh about it all tomorrow, couldn't we?
When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
What you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?
Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
Yeah, no, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
Do your thing it goes like this
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
Yeah, no, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
Yeah, no, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more

I've been so good, I've been helpful and friendly
I've been so good, why am I feeling empty?
I've been so good, I've been so good this year
I've been so good, but it's still getting harder
I've been so good, where the hell is the karma?
I've been so good, I've been so good this year
Why, are you asking me why?
My days and nights are filled with disappointment
Fine, oh no, everything's fine
I'm not sure why I booked today's appointment
I've been so good, I've been helpful and friendly
I've been so good, why am I feeling empty?
I've been so good, I've been so good this year
I've been so good, but it's still getting harder
I've been so good, where the hell is the karma?
I've been so good, I've been so good this year
What, am I normal or not?
Am I crazier than other patients?
Right, I've done everything right
So where's the karma doc, I've lost my patience
'Cause I've been so good, I've been working my ass off
I've been so good, still, I'm lonely and stressed out
I've been so good, I've been so good this year
And I've been so good, but it's still getting harder
I've been so good, where the hell is the karma?
I've been so good, I've been so good this year
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I've been so good this year
I've been so good this year
Time, I know we're out of time
But what if sad thoughts come and I can't stop it
Bye, I don't wanna say bye
If only I could keep you in my pocket
To give me some diagnosis of why I'm so hollow
Please give me instructions, I promise I'll follow
I tripped on my ankle and fractured my elbow
But doesn't that mean that the tour's gonna sell though?
I try to explain the good faith that's been wasted
But after an hour it sounds like complaining
Wait don't go away, can I lie here forever?
You say that I'm better, why don't I feel better?
The universe works in mysterious ways
But I'm starting to think it ain't working for me
Doctor, should I be good?
Should I be good this year?
