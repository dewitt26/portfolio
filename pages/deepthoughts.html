    <div class=box>Hello this is my deep thoughts page. Here you will find various things Emma thinks about.

    <div class=box>What's been on Emma's mind lately...
        Recently I have been thinking a lot about college and college applications. Right now, a few schools I would really like to apply to include the University of Minnesota, Gustavus Adolphus College, the University of St. Thomas, and UW-Madison. I know i would definitely like to study business, however I am not sure what type of business yet. Right now I really enjoy my AP Economics class, so I might consider a major in Economics. I am alos considering getting a minor in computer scienece becasue it is also a class I enjoy a lot, and I alos think it would pair well with business. I have also been considering the idea of minoring in Spanish as well. I have taken SPanisg for 13 years, so I was thinking it might be good to continue studying it in college.
