    <div class=boxp3> Below you will find my chemotaxis project. By clicking the center snowball with the buttons, you will start the project. </div>
    
    <div class=boxp4> My main challenges during the chemotaxis project were being ab,le to get the snowmen to come out of the cvorrect part of teh screen. Another challenge was trying to reset the code each time the center of teh snowman is clicked so that the snowmen would reappear each time the center was clicked. I was able to fox these issues by adding some booleans, if statements, and for loops. </div>
